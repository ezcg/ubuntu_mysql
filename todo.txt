rebuild and rerun dc1.yml
does it create user named 'user' in mysql?
does it create database 'laravel_docker'?
does it need to run mysql/mysql8.0_initialize.sh? If not, rename mysql8.0_initialize.sh

for docker images: how does dc decide repository, tag

does MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=root work in dc yml?

delete all images and build each again, deleting all images in between each build

build ubuntu24_mysql

[Server] root@localhost is created with an empty password ! Please consider switching off the --initialize-insecure option.
That is just a warning printed by during database file initialization (mysqld --initialize-insecure). The root user with password is created later while the database is listening only on the unix socket.
